# Druid Talent Information

One thing to keep in mind is that using multiple forms should be normalized. It's one thing to be actively tanking and always being in `BearForm`. But the thing that will make you stand out and put you in the high level category is if you can find the right time to use the right form.

## Notable talents by Scenario

### Questing / Solo

- _Feral_/_Guardian_ talents work well together in the class tree. 
- `Feline Swiftness` - often not necessary to have max DPS and moving quickly can be helpful.
- `Hibernate` - situational if you want to sleep a beast.
- `Primal Fury` - Consider taking this as _guardian_ as the crit increase is more helpful then mitigation you won't likely need. There are other talents though that you might take on right hand side though.

### Raid

- _Guardian_
  - Most tank mechanics have you swapping. If you can be in `Cat Form`, the `Cat Form` talents will improve your DPS.
  - Many basic builds include `Incapacitating Roar` but if you don't need it, `Fluid Form` can be better if you'll be swapping a lot.
- `Remove Corruption` - Situational. If you need to dispel a curse or poison, take it.

### Mythic+/Dungeon

- _Guardian_
  - You'll often always be in `Bear Form`. Unless there is a boss where you won't be actively tanking, the `Cat Form` talents aren't usually helpful. 
  - You may want the speed increase though, so taking `Rake` + `Feline Swiftness` is OK if you have room in your talents.
- _Restoration_
  - You'll likely be catweaving meaning you'll taking `Cat Form` talents in the base tree so you can do damage when you aren't healing.
  - `Cat Form` damage is superior to _Balance_ in almost every way. You'd only ever want to take the ranged DPS talents if you just simply can't be in melee range.
  - Catweaving is cool because you feel like a real druid. Very reminiscent of original druid when I was using all spells and multiple forms. 
- `Remove Corruption` - Situational. If you need to dispel a curse or poison, take it.
- `Sunfire` / `Improved Sunfire` - Great for _Restoration_ and _Balance_. For _Restoration_, this is a good beginner in packs before shifting into `Cat Form`.

### Legacy Content

- You'll almost always want to be _Feral_ because it offers the most speed and quick hits.
- `Feline Swiftness` - Great for legacy content. You are OP and so power skills aren’t as useful. Getting through content faster with this and a speed set is great.
- `Tiger Dash` - Technically a speed up (12% vs 21% if `Dash` and `Tiger Dash` can be used on cooldown) and useful here because you don't likely need `Wild Charge` unless under water.

## Class Talents

For lower levels, you'll often take some subset of left, middle, or right to get down the tree. We actually have comparatively powerful class talents near the bottom, so you'll sort of want to decide which of those you need for each given scenario and then plan an optimal path to them.

### Level 1

- Rake
  - Default in _Feral_.
  - Will you be using `Cat Form`? 
  - Catweaving or _Guardian_ where you can be in `Cat Form`.
  - `Rip` and `Maim` require learning this.

- Frenzied Regeneration
  - Default in _Guardian_.
  - Do you need to heal in `Bear Form`?
  - Do you need `Ironfur` or possibly, `Thrash` and `Improved Barkskin`?
  - Might be useful for when you know you’ll take a big hit and want the healing as well as DR in `Bear Form`.

- Rejuvenation
  - Default in _Restoration_.
  - Do you need `Remove Corruption` or possibly `Improved Barkskin`?
  - Do you need an off heal in between shifting forms?
  - Might be useful to help with a quick heal where a full `Regrowth` might not be needed or in addition to a `Regrowth` where it might not be enough.

- Starfire
  - Default in _Balance_.
  - Do you need `Starsurge` or `Sunfire`?
  - You'll likely not need this unless you are _Balance_ or want to pick up `Sunfire`.

### Level 2

- Feline Swiftness
  - Will the added speed be helpful?
  - If taking `Rake`, this might be a nice filler if you need more to get to new tiers. 
  - Great for questing and legacy content.

- Thrash
  - Default in _Guardian_.
  - Good for melee AoE in `Cat Form` and _Feral_.

- Improved Barkskin
  - How long do you need damage mitigation?
  - Improved mitigation uptime for _Guardian_.
  - In other specs, might be useful if you will have more than 8 seconds of incoming damage, though this doesn't happen a lot.

- Remove Corruption / Improved Nature's Cure
  - Later for _Restoration_. Likely taken unless you know what you want dispelled and it's only magic.
  - Removing curses and poisons is situational but very helpful. Having a non-healer with one can be huge for certain encounters.

- Starsurge
  - Default in _Balance_.
  - Not really useful elsewhere unless you can't be in melee range.

### Level 3

- Rip
  - Default in _.
  - Catweaving or _Guardian_ where you can be in `Cat Form`.

- Ironfur
  - Mandatory in _Guardian_.
  - Not likely useful elsewhere unless you need to tank a big hit and you know ahead of time.

- Verdant Heart
  - Likely a pick for _Guardian_.
  - Not likely useful elsewhere unless you know the damage profile and the received healing is meaningful.

- Wild Growth
  - Default in _Restoration_.
  - Not likely useful elsewhere unless you are off-healing and stopping DPS to help heal might work.

- Sunfire
  - Mandatory in _Balance_.
  - Catweaving can make use of this in conjunction with `improved Sunfire` to improve DPS.

### Level 4

- Maim
  - Helpful for questing and solo content.
  - The stun has limited help in group content. Maybe in cases where you need more CC/kick in your group but spending combo points here is a loss in DPS.

- Killer Instinct
  - Almost always used in _Feral_ and _Guardian_ because its static increase in damage and survivability.
  - It's also the only way to get to `Skull Bash` which is taken in most content.

- Hibernate
  - Very situational. Not usually helpful because of limitation.
  - Often though `Prowl`ing past mobs is better and easier.

- Nurturing Instinct
  - Other side of coin of `Killer Instinct`.
  - Almost always taken in _Restoration_ and _Balance_.
  - Also usually taken in _Guardian_ and _Feral_ because you want to go up the right side of tree later and this will get you there.

- Improved Sunfire
  - Group based AoE helpful for Mythic+ especially when Catweaving.
  - Usually better talents in _Guardian_ and _Feral_ so not taken there.

### Level 5

- Skull Bash
  - Druid Kick (`Solar Beam` enters the chat).
  - Having this during tanking and melee DPS is huge.
  - Whenever you are taking some `Cat Form`, you'll often take this as well. Even in Mythic+ as _Restoration_, taking it is helpful increasing the kicks in your group.

- Thick Hide
  - Basically used everywhere.
  - Straight up mitigation is gud.
  - Compared to other talent lower in the tree is usually straight up better.

- Mass Entanglement / Ursol's Vortex
  - `Ursol's Vortex` almost always better.
  - Taken in most builds because it's a better use of a point.
  - Also only way to get `Soothe` / `Cyclone` and further down middle tree which happens in most scenarios.
  - When would you use `Mass Entanglement`? Maybe if you have to outrun a group or keep it at a distance. Very unlikely to need it.

- Natural Recovery
  - Situational.
  - It _does_ work with your own healing (e.g. `Rejuvenation`).
  - Will you be receiving a lot of healing? If so, this may be an improvement.
  - You may not take it though as other talents may offer better things. For example, _Guardian_ would be trading this for some mitigation or DPS talents that are far more impactful.

- Astral Influence
  - Because _Feral_ and _Guardian_ can now get higher talents without picking this, it's potentially optional.
  - It takes some getting used to now that it's optional because you are used to `Thrash` and such hitting further.
  - Maybe useful in _Restoration_ and _Balance_ where the increased range will allow you to move less in raids.
  - Necessary in _Balance_ if you want _Starlight Conduit_ (and you likely do).

### Level 6

- Primal Fury
  - Mandatory for _Feral_. You want the extra combo points for more finishers.
  - Also worth taking if catweaving.
  - _Guardian_ is situational. If you don't need more mitigation, the increase to mangle crit is helpful.

- Wild Charge / Tiger Dash
  - `Wild Charge` almost always better.
  - Taken in almost all scenarios because movement is usually necessary.
  - You also need it to get down left side of tree.

- Soothe
  - Technically situational.
  - You'll probably use it in most situations though.
  - You often have a few points to place and this is usually better.

- Cyclone
  - Very situational.
  - Not the best CC so isn't usually taken unless you don't need `Soothe` and want to go down the middle (you likely do).

- Renewal
  - Big self heal used almost everywhere especially you almost always want to go a bit down the right hand side.

- Starlight Conduit
  - Mandatory for _Balance_.
  - Can't think of a reason why you'd want it otherwise.

### Level 7

- Matted Fur
  - The absorb is meaningful in many cases.
  - Some people take `Ursine Vigor` when only picking one but you'll often take both. The trade off when only taking one is knowing the damage profiles.

- Ursine Vigor
  - If you are swapping to `Cat Form` for DPS as guardian when not actively tanking, this might be helpful to mitigate initial damage where your `Ironfur` might not be up.
  - Many specs will take this though to reduce incoming damage, especially on higher keys or when a high damage spell is hitting the group.

- Ursoc's Spirit
  - Basically mandatory as _Guardian_.
  - You often won't need it otherwise.
  - Again though, in high keys where you shift to `Bear Form` to mitigate some big hit, often the increase health percentage can offset healing by quite a bit.

- Stampeding Roar
  - Basically mandatory.
  - You want to go down the tree in essentially all cases.
  - This is one of the best movement buffs in the game for mythic+ and raids.

- Improved Rejuvenation
  - Only useful when casting `Rejuvenation` a lot (e.g. _Restoration_ in raid).

- Rising Light, Falling Night 
  - You'll often be taking this to get to right side of tree as it's more generally useful than `Typhoon`.
  - From what I can tell, all instanced content is "day". So if you think this is cool for `Bear Form`, it's really only if you play late at night in open world.

- Typhoon
  - Very situational.
  - I see some builds using it where other talents are probably better.
  - In instances where you have room and the extra "kick" is helpful you can take it.
  - You won't often take as _Restoration_ because you don't have the points available.

### Level 8

This area has a lot of "mandatory" because you want to get the talents further down. You'll almost always take two of the three if not all three.

- Instincts of the Claw
  - In almost any build, you want to at least one point further down the tree, so you'll be getting this.
  - That being said, the straight up damage increase is good for most builds.
  - Less helpful in _Balance_, but you often want the other talents further down.

- Lycara's Teachings
  - Same as above, you almost always take it to get further down.

- Lore of the Grove
  - Same as above, but less so.
  - Many talents down this tree are good but I'm more meh on them than others.
  - Still you'll often take the straight up buffs to your spells over other alternatives even if you don't go down this tree.

### Level 9

- Oakskin
  - There are a lot of places where the increased DR is good. 
  - Potentially not taken in raids as _Restoration_ because you'll use points elsewhere.

- Incapacitating Roar / Mighty Bash
  - When picking this, do you want AoE stun or single target?
  - In mythic+, acts as a second "kick" though some mobs will just go back to casting after. You'll want to know which spells are on a timer and use it for them. Alternatively, for big packs where there are a lot of spell casting, using this can be big for mitigation.

- Improved Stampeding Roar
  - Situational, technically.
  - In most places where you want `Stampeding Roar`, you'll want this.
  - The only reason you wouldn't is if the 1 minute difference doesn't affect your team or you don't have the points.

- Fluid Form
  - The question you ask here is, does the GCD affect you enough to take this?
  - In catweaving this can be really useful because you can quickly get back to form and save multiple GCDs.
  - When tank swapping, same applies, you can save 2 GCD's per swap.

- Forestwalk
  - Limited usefulness.
  - If you cast `Regrowth` a lot if can help with movement. 
  - In raids when you want to get healed up quickly and need to move around.
  - In _Feral_/_Guardian_ when you proc `Predatory Swiftness`/`Dream of Cenarius` this applies and can be helpful.

- Innervate
  - Become a healer's best friend.
  - `Nature's Vigil` is popular choice and so you might take this over `Forestwalk`.
  - Consider the mana usage. If your healer will be drinking a lot this might be an OK 3 minute alternative. If you have a particularly long fight in a raid, taking this will give you several uses for mana conservation.

### Level 10

- Well-Honed Instincts
  - This is often taken because it can be a lot of free healing in any encounter.
  - That being said, if you know your damage profile wouldn't regularly proc it, then you won't want it.

- Heart of the Wild
  - This is definitely situation but can be powerful.
  - Catweaving can make extremely good use of this.
  - _Guardian_ seems to only benefit from `Moonfire` unless you can be in `Cat Form` for part of the duration. For example, you might pop this if you won't be actively tanking in raid and can go wild during a `Bloodlust`.
  - For _Balance_ and _Feral_ though, you'll not likely be using this unless you need to output some heavy heals or tank a big hit in a very niche situation.

- Nature's Vigil
  - _Restoration_ does damage based on healing, other specs do reverse.
  - The uptime is relatively small (e.g. like 10 spells) so pick the right time to use.
  - _Feral_ and catweaving can take most advantage of this to give self or party healing.
  - _Restoration_ won't often have the talent points though if catweaving because it wants other talents that are more impactful on the other side.
